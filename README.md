<!-- How to install -->
## How to instal:
Clone repository from GitHub or download it. 

Install extra libraries from requirements.txt.
Open your terminal in project folder and type:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  

Creating global database, open python console and type:
  ```sh
  from app import db, app
  db.create_all(app=app)
  ```
  
Start application:
  
  
  Unix Bash (Linux, Mac):
  ```sh
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=1
$ export FLASK_APP=app
$ flask run
 ```

Windows CMD:
```
> set FLASK_DEBUG=1
> set FLASK_APP=app
> flask run
```
Windows PowerShell:
```
> $env:FLASK_DEBUG=1 
> $env:FLASK_APP="app" 
> flask run
```
 FLASK_DEBUG=1 is not necessary. It allows to restart the server automatically after code changes.

## User settings:


### Activating ReCaptcha:

I used ReCaptcha to prevent my site from bots. First you need to register your site on Google and get keys from them.


### Evironment Variables :
My program is able to send activations code on emails. First you need to create evironment variables to keep your data safe.

I recommend this Corey's video how to do that on Windows, Mac and Linux. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8)

In my code i created variables just like bellow. You can name it however you like, but you need to sure, that variables are named the same in python and your OS. Those variables are in constans.py file.
If variables returns None, I recommend to restart computer after adding those variables.
