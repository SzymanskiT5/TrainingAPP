## User settings:

### Sending emails :
My program is able to send activations code on emails. First you need to create evironment variables to keep your data safe.

I recommend this Corey's video how to do that on Windows, Mac and Linux. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8)

In my code i created variables "EMAIL_PASS" and "EMAIL_USER". You can name it however you like, but you need to sure, that variables are named the same in python and your OS.

## Activating ReCaptcha:

I used ReCaptcha to prevent my site from bots. First you need to register your site on Google and get keys from them.
